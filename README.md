1. Title: Modifying Packing Algorithms to Allow Object Rotation
2. Overview:I want to modify an existing two-dimensional object packing algorithm to pack 
irregular objects that can be rotated freely by creating simplified representations of rotations of 
each object and selectively packing these representations at each step in the algorithm
3. Requirements: None
4. Installation Instructions: Add any images of objects you want to be packed and an image for the container you want them to be packed in to the folder with Main.py. Images should contain the object against a white background, and objects will only be packed in white areas of the container image. For the current version of code, it is best to use small images to decrease run time.
5. Run instructions: 
Execute the file Main.py. Fill in prompts asking for the number of objects to be packed, names of object files, and the widths of objects as they appear in their image. Outputted file of packing is called "final.png".
