1. Title: Modifying Packing Algorithms to Allow Object Rotation
2. Overview:I want to modify an existing two-dimensional object packing algorithm to pack 
irregular objects that can be rotated freely by creating simplified representations of rotations of 
each object and selectively packing these representations at each step in the algorithm
3. Requirements: None
4. Installation Instructions: For any images representing objects to be packed, add pictures of objects against white backgrounds. 
Name images "1.png", "2.png", etc., in order for them to be packed. 
5. Run instructions: Edit "widths.txt" so that it is a tab-separated file with two columns, one of image numbers (with 0 corresponding to container) and one of corresponding widths
Execute the file Main.py. Outputted file of packing is called "final.png". (current version of code does not have text file, 
edit "widths" array in Main.py to specify different widths).
